      <strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the Web, 
      is an information system 
      <br>where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
      <u><strong>(https://example.com/)</strong></u> <br>which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, 
      and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer 
      <strong>Protocol (HTTP)</strong>, may be accessed by users by <br>a software application called a web browser, 
      and are published by a software application called a web server. <br><strong>The World Wide Web</strong> 
      is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
